## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders of this project pledge to make participation in our community a respectful, inclusive, and harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

This repository is dedicated to the development and maintenance of open API specification standards. We welcome diverse perspectives and collaborative input, and we strive to build a professional and inclusive community that produces high-quality, usable, and interoperable standards.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our community include:

- Thoughtful and respectful discussion and feedback
- Constructive contributions aligned with the project's goals
- Tactful disagreement with explanations and alternatives
- Welcoming new participants and mentoring others
- Acknowledging differing technical backgrounds or use cases

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

- Deliberate misrepresentation or hostile trolling of proposals or feedback

## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.
